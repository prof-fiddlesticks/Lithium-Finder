# Lithium-Finder
A GEE Javascript code to find Lithium.

How Multi_Sensor_Analysis works:

Explaining Veg Stress Marker:

Theory: Lithium and its "pathfinder" elements are toxic to plants. The darker/black patches in the image indicate the areas where the plants are under highest stress. If a Dark Patch on the Veg Stress map sits directly on top of a Red Patch on the Heatmap, you have found a site where the mineral deposit is likely shallow enough to affect the surface biology. This is a "Grade A" drilling target.

How to read Lithium Potential Heatmap:

Deep red areas are lithium "goldilocks" zones, at these areas almost all of the 20 markers are triggering, making a high chance of finding lithium. Yellow/Green areas are "potential" zones for lithium to be, some markers might be there but others not. Blue/Dark Blue areas are lithium "negative" zones, there are little to no markers being shown here.
